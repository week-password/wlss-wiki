# Соглашения. Работа с гитом

### Rebase-squash flow
We are using "Rebase flow" to work with git. It means that any feature branch will be merge only after rebasing on the last version of `develop`. And after all "work in progress" commits is squashed into one commit with a descriptive commit message.


### Fast forward
All commits should be merged using fast-forward option, so there will be no merge commits in `develop` branch.


### Branch naming convention:
Since we are merging feature branches via fast-forward algorithm, there is no much sense to have some branching conventions. Because all feature branches will be deleted after merging and there will be no chance to know the name of the feature branch.


### About rebasing:
You can work within your feature branch any way you want. Feel free to add any commits with any commit messages you are comfortable with. You can rebase it (interactively too) and force push it. This is a place where you can work and feel comfortable.

After you've finished your work:
1. Pull last version of `develop`.
2. Rebase your feature branch onto `develop`.
3. Resolve conflicts (if any).
4. Force push your feature branch.
5. Create a PR.
6. Add changes after review.

The next steps is for reviewer. After PR has been approved:
1. Squash all commits into one.
2. Add descriptive message to it.
3. Fast-forward merge into `develop` using Git (not GitHub).
4. Remove old feature branch.


### About commit message
Since we squash all commits into one, we need to provide a descriptive commit message.

- First line is a ticket title compied as is, whitespace, and ticket and ticket number in parenthesies with a hashtag.
- Second line is empty.
- Third line and below is the ticket description copied as is in Markdown format.
  But if markdown has some heading in it - lines with one/more leading hashtags (`### Heading`) - then we have to remove these hashtags, otherwise these lines will be ignored by git because hashtags means a comment line for git.
- Last line is empty.

For example:
```
Add login page (#11)

After we've added registration functionality (issue https://github.com/EugeneTurkin/forum123/issues/9),
we can go further and add login page without functionality.

In the scope of this task we need to add login page and logout button.

Steps to do:

    - add html template with login form in it (form fields should be: `username`, `password`)
    - add flask route for login page `/login` which renders this form
    - add "Sign In" button to the header of the base template (which will redirect to `/login`)
```
